## 译文
- 不要在`Awake()`中调用方法
只在`Awake()`中显式的设置自身的状态数据

- 所有状态应当在`Start()`时可以被安全的访问
这样就不用在`Start()`小心翼翼的检查各种变量的初始状态了


## 原文
- Don't call methods in  `Awake()`

Well we do call some methods in `Awake()`, but we never call any methods that are on `MonoBehaviours` or `ScriptableObjects` . These two types both themselves have `Awake()` methods. We use `Awake()` exclusively for setting up ourselves with data that we already have.

- All state should be safe to access by `Start()`

That means that we would need to be really careful we need to check all uses of variables that are initialized in `Start()`.
